Jesus
=====

Resurrect processes if they die.

Overview
--------

Jesus is a simple-ish process management tool. It's designed to be very light,
while still providing functions enough to be automated if necessary. To that
end, it only runs a single process to monitor all your stuff. It can be exposed
via a unix socket (default) or an actual network interface for automation.

Installation
------------

Available via [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

> $ npm install jesus -g

Or via git:

> $ npm install git://github.com/deoxxa/jesus.git -g

Usage
-----

```
usage: jesus [-h] [-v]
             {listen,daemon,start,stop,stopall,restart,restartall,check,list}
